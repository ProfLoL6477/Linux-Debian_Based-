# Linux-Debian-Based Setup Scripts

This repository contains shell scripts that help you quickly set up essential software on Debian-based Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.).


Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

Ensure your system is running a Debian-based Linux distribution. If you're using a different distribution, some commands may vary.


Downloading and Running a Script:

  Download the script you need directly from this repository. Click on the script file (e.g., VSCode_Install.sh), then click the "Download" button or right-click on the "Raw" button and select "Save      Link As" to save the file.

  Navigate to the directory where you saved the script. You can either:

  Open the terminal manually and use cd to navigate to the folder:

  ```bash

    cd /path/to/your/script
```

  Alternative: You can right-click on the folder in your file explorer and select "Open in Terminal" to open a terminal directly in that folder.
  

Make the script executable by running the following command:

```bash
  # Make the script executable
  chmod +x script_name.sh
  
  # Run the script
  sudo ./script_name.sh
```


Available Scripts:

Currently, the repository contains the following scripts:

  boot_clean.sh - A basic system maintenance script.

  debian_setup.sh - Automated basic setup for Debian based systems.

  grub_customizer_install.sh - Installs GRUB Customizer, a tool for managing the GRUB bootloader.
  
  octave_install.sh - Installs GNU Octave, a software for numerical computations.

  ubuntu_lts_upgrade.sh - Upgrade Ubuntu to the next LTS release.

  ubuntu_upgrade.sh - Upgrade Ubuntu to the next available release (not necessarily the next LTS release).
  
  vscode_install.sh - Installs Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor.
  

More Scripts Coming Soon:

This repository will be updated with more scripts to automate the installation of other useful tools and software. Keep checking back for updates!

# Linux-Debian-Based Setup Scripts

This repository contains shell scripts that help you quickly set up essential software on Debian-based Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.).

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Ensure your system is running a Debian-based Linux distribution. If you're using a different distribution, some commands may vary.

Downloading and Running a Script

  Download the script you need directly from this repository. Click on the script file (e.g., VSCode_Install.sh), then click the "Download" button or right-click on the "Raw" button and select "Save      Link As" to save the file.

  Navigate to the directory where you saved the script. You can either:

  Open the terminal manually and use cd to navigate to the folder:

  ```bash

    cd /path/to/your/script
```

  Alternative: You can right-click on the folder in your file explorer and select "Open in Terminal" to open a terminal directly in that folder.

Make the script executable by running the following command:

```bash
  # Make the script executable
  chmod +x ScriptName.sh
  
  # Run the script
  sudo ./ScriptName.sh
```

  BootClean.sh - A basic system maintenance script.
